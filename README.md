## Population size monitoring of the brown pelican by counting and categorizing nests on Isla Ballena, B.C.S. (2018 - 2020).

- This project was part of my results for my bachelor's thesis project.

- The data were obtained from photographs processed as orthomosaics. 

- The counting and categorization of the nests, as well as the subsequent data and measurements, were performed in QGIS.

- Statistical analyses were performed using R.


# [Minnesota's Traffic Volumes](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rams.s.p.rez/viz/MinnesotasTrafficVolumes/TV_Dashboard)

- This project was part of my Google BI Professional Certificate.

- The main objective was to compare traffic volume at different times and on different time scales, and to examine vacation and weather patterns throughout the year.

- To do so, the following charts were created: traffic volumes by month and year, traffic volumes by time of day, traffic volumes organized by weather patterns, and a pie chart of the busiest holidays.
