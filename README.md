## [Anomalous nuclei detector and classifier]
### Automated detection of anomalous nuclei in seabird erythrocytes (Work in progress)

<!-- - This project is in collaboration with the Marine Aeroecology Laboratory (CICESE-ULP). -->
- First part: Trained model that automatically detects and trims 1000 nuclei.
- Second part: Analysis of the nuclei in their shape, size, length and width in pixels, and other characteristics.
- Third part: Classification according to its characteristics: healthy or anomalous.

## [Google BI Project](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rams.s.p.rez/viz/CyclisticProject_16922197668730/Cyclistic)

### Google BI workplace scenario: Cyclistic

- This end-of-course project was part of the Google Business Intelligence Professional Certificate.

- This is a fictitious workplace scenario, where the imaginary company "Cyclistic" has partnered with New York City to provide a bike-share service. 

- The objetive was to understand how their customers are using their bikes; their top priority was identifying customer demand at different station locations.

## [Brown pelican nest monitoring](https://github.com/ra-mss/Power-BI-Projects/blob/main/ISLABALLENA.pdf)

### Population size monitoring of the brown pelican by counting and categorizing nests on Isla Ballena, B.C.S. (2018 - 2020)

- This project was part of my results for my bachelor's thesis project.

- The data were obtained from photographs processed as orthomosaics. 

- The counting and categorization of the nests, as well as the subsequent data and measurements, were performed in QGIS.

- Statistical analyses were performed using R.

## [Minnesota's Traffic Volumes](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rams.s.p.rez/viz/MinnesotasTrafficVolumes/TV_Dashboard)

- This project was part of my Google BI Professional Certificate.

- The main objective was to compare traffic volume at different times and on different time scales, and to examine vacation and weather patterns throughout the year.

- To do so, the following charts were created: traffic volumes by month and year, traffic volumes by time of day, traffic volumes organized by weather patterns, and a pie chart of the busiest holidays.
